						<h2>My Learning Style</h2>
						<h3>About my Learning Style</h3>
						<p>
						According to the Gregorc thinking style quiz, I am a concrete random thinker. (Fun fact: I took the quiz twice 2 weeks apart and got nearly identical results. Only one point was different and it was not in my most dominant personality type category.) You can read about the different personality profiles <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target=blank>here.</a> I also found a lot of useful information <a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm" target=blank>here</a> that I really agreed with for myself personally. Here is what they had to say about my type:</p>

						<h2>Javascript</h2>
						<h3>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h3>
						<p>
						A lot of it has to do with history and context. When there is a giant wildfire in the forest, no one asks, "Gee what was so special and flammable about that first branch that caught fire? Because surely if it weren't for that particular branch, there would have been no wildfire!" That would be sillly. Instead you ask, "What were the conditions in the forest that day that allowed any branch to catch fire and cause such a huge conflagration? And furthermore, given those conditions, what kind of branch could be eligible to start a fire?" Javascript's creator was smart...and lucky...and he was smart enough to know what would be "lucky". He saw an opportunity, he saw a void, and he saw what it would take to fill it.</p>

						<h2>Display Inline vs Inline Block</h2>
						<h3>Display Block</h3>
						<p>
						If an element is being displayed block:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>it will not allow other elements to sit to the right of it on the same level as itself. There is a built in line break after a block.
								</li>
								<li>It will respect margins/paddings on all sides of it.</li>
								<li>it will respect height and width settings.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Comparing My Favorite Sites</h2>
						<h3>The Rap Insider, New York Magazine, Genius.com</h3>
						<p>
						1.) The Rap Insider: I love this site because of the hilarious content first and foremost...and I also think it is pretty good looking. I like its simple fonts and the uniformity of formal elements. I also like the red, white and black color scheme. I feel like color schemes that have a lot of secondary colors look cheesy because they clash with the photos (obviously I am aware that my site is quite cheesy). Having red just makes the photos pop and everything still seems to match.
						</p>
						<p>
						At first glance my eye is drawn to the large slideshow photo on the top left. After stepping back, I think my eye is also drawn to the "Join TRI!" announcement and the logo on top.
