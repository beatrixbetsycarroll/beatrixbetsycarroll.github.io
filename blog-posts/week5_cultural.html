        <h1>Pairing</h1>
            <h2>An Exercise in Collaboration and Vulnerability</h2>
            <p>Pairing and getting feedback on how you are doing as a pair is very important in the art of writing code. However, it requires you to make yourself vulnerable to criticism and to put yourself out there.</p>
            <p>One thing that I find challenging about pairing is that I often feel inclined to figure things out in my head alone before discussing them out loud. I think that that comes from my instinctive desire to not "dumb" or like I don't know what I am doing at all times in front of my pair. So I think that comes right back to the vulnerability thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              However I think that getting feedback doesn't really upset me at all even if it is negative. So I should realize that the stakes are not high, I don't mind hearing how I can improve, so I shouldn't be so worried about how I "come off" to my pair anyways. I mean, obviously I should be concerned if I am being a good pair, but I shouldn't worry about seeming inferior. Speaking of vulnerability, this has been a very vulnerable post for me!

            <p>Thanks for stopping by and reading my thoughts.</p>
