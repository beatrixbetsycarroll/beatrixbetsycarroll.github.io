        <h1>The Biggest Problem in Tech</h1>

            <h2>Lack of Diversity in the Tech Community</h2>
            <h3>all vanilla and no other flavors makes the tech world a dull white boy</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest problems facing the tech community is the lack of diversity amongst its constituents. Women and minorities are significantly underrepresented in the field. Check out <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/26/silicon-valley-tech-diversity-white-asian-black-hispanic-google-facebook-yahoo/11372421/" target=blank>this</a> infographic to really see what I am talkin about.</p>

            <h3>Threat to the Tech Community</h3>
            <p>
            A lack of diversity in the field means that there is a dearth of variety of opinions, backgrounds, and ideas. People of different ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, genders, sexual orientations, etc often have different life experiences because of how they were perceived and what they were exposed to growing up. People with different experiences have different outlooks and insights on the world. You want to have as many different insights as possible when you are creating something for users, because those users will be people other than yourself. In fact the target user may be someone very different from yourself. Conversely, when you have a group people who are all from a similar set of circumstances, their cumulative collection of outlooks and insights will fall short of that of the group that is more diverse.</p>
            <h3>One example off the top of my shopping cart...</h3>
            <p>
            I can think of an example of how design can benefit from diversity that I have experienced in through my online dress browsing addiction. A lot of Web sites for browsing women's clothing have what I consider less than stellar user experiences. The most prevalent designs for a clothes shopping site allow you to sort by color, size, brand, type of apparel (skirt, pants, shoes), type of type of apparel (heel height of shoe), and a lot of the time that's kind of about it. Those filters encompass all of the parameters that a straight male would be able to see if he looked at women's clothing, but they fall very short of many a woman's view of her sartorial repertoire.</p>
            <p>
              When my dad looks at my closet he is disturbed by my vast collection of short black dresses because to him they are all just the same short black dress (and also because they are strewn across my bedroom floor). But I know that some are risque in the neckline, some are "flowy", some are fancy, some are only okay for me to wear on "skinny days", and some are just a nicer looking potato sack (aka "fat day" wear).
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why Rent the Runway's user experience makes me say "now that's more like it!" everytime I visit it. It allows you to sort by length, color, formality, trend, body type, occasion, sleeve, neckline, age, style, and designer. Rent the Runway was founded and is run by women and has an above average percentage of women on their engineering team. And I think it shows! A lot of sites have been adding similar features of late, but I remember when it felt like RtR was the only one.
            </p>
            <h3>But there are a ton of better reasons to fix the problem...</h3>
            <p>
              You can imagine all the unknown ways the entire sphere of technology products and services is suffering, just as all of the presumably-male-made women's clothing Web sites are. I don't even want to try to articulate a speculative example, simply because I am relatively blind to experiences other than my own as a (white) woman (hence why the Rent the Runway example is what strikes me). But lets just be clear: there are a lot. Technology can be useful for everyone and should help everyone. So in order to create it well, input from everyone is necessary.</p>
            <p>
              You don't need to think that the tech community should add more diversity as a form of charity to benefit "diverse" people to realize that we are all going to miss out if we don't.
            </p>
            That is why I put that Rent the Runway argument first; I think that to even a purely self-interested white male technologist, it should be more than enough on its own. I do think there is another argument though--one that has to do with altruistically attempting to correct some of the undue influence that culture and society has had on to a lot of people. Even if all things were equal in terms of opportunity across different demographics (and obviously they are not), the prejudice in the ether that surrounds us all has a way of pigeonholing people into the stereotype of their "type", thus causing a self fulfilling prophecy in that person's' sense of identity and even, subsequently, his/her "group" at large. I think that attempting to do what they can from the top down to help assuage this is the least that the people at the "top" can do.
            <h3>Potential solutions...</h3>
            <p>
              And in fact, one potential solution does come from the top. I think that organizations with the money and power to do so should be setting up a lot of scholarship programs, incentives, etc, to help women and minorites explore their talents, and give them a chance and a reason to see what they can do in tech. There are a lot of great organizaions already doing this. Dev Boot Camp is one, with its Levoe scholarship. Google has programs as well. I think we need more of the same, as well as a shift in education. Programming should be a required class. Lose the French and Spanish and give 'em a chance to explore some languages that most kids won't ever come across on their own--like Ruby and Javascript!--in their studies at school.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a gender perspective, parents can make an effort to treat their daughters the way they treat their sons. If you must supply them with a ton of pink stuff (because they have been trained by the media to beg for it until you reach your breaking point), buy them pink Goldiblox. Make sure to compliment your daughters on their grit, their ingenuity, their energy, their boldness (insert all words used to praise little boys here) instead of their beauty, their social skills, their tact, their mature people skills. Don't underestimate how all these little things can condition little girls to be more hesitant about pursuing engineering. I won't try to get into that now because you should be able to connect some of the dots (telling a girl she is good at the soft skills implies she is not as good at the hard skills, and over time you slowly point her towards poetry and HR and away from math and tech and engineering.)
