        <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>

            <h2>My Main Value: Confidence</h2>
            <h3>Every Human's Right</h3>
            <p>
            I would say that one of my most important values is confidence. I think confidence really is the key to success, and that confidence (a healthy dose) creates a positive feedback loop that will lead to accomplishment and happiness. I truly believe that every human in the world has the right to confidence, and that every person has all the opportunities before them that they need to create reasons to be confident.</p>
            <p>
            Of course not everyone will be made able to see this truth because of bad circumstances that stand in the way, and therefore not everyone will act on it. So many people will remain in a state of loathing themselves because they have valid reasons to feel guilt and shame, and they do not see how they can get beyond their situation, get away from their past, and create reasons to feel pride in what they offer to the world.
            </p>
            <h3>A Room of One's Own...In Prison</h3>
            <p>
              For instance I heard the story of a man who was serving a long sentence in prison for murdering someone when he was 19. At some point in his sentence, he was placed in solitary confinement. He was filled with hate and misery and was always acting out. While he was there, he somehow ended up reading the greatest philosophy works. He became exposed to one book, was moved, and continued reading more. He now writes philosophy books, gives talks to prisoners, even gave a TED talk--he adds goodness and beauty to the world now that he has moved passed his shame, and he started that life for himself while he was still behind bars. If you have the ability to be a moral person at your disposal, then you can act on that ability, and then you already have all the reasons in the world to be confident with yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think that every person I meet is an interesting and worthwhile person, and yet so many good people are insecure. I think that everyone (who is a good person) should be confident, precisely because confidence is the thing that will propel you towards acheiving the goals that you feel will make you worthy of the confidence. Even if one's confidence is "unfounded" or "faked", I think it leads to respectable and deserving behaviors.

            <h3>If a Kardashian has a strong sense of self-worth, shouldn't we all?</h3>
            <p>
              Another example, although I admit this one is sort of silly, is Khloe Kardashian. When I was younger I watched their reality show and I watched her get cheated on by a very high profile boyfriend, and then dump him and deal with her pain in a healthy way without looking back. I remember thinking, wow, she is so cool. What confidence. She doesn't even have a job or a college degree but she knows her worth and she makes it known to others by not putting up with bad treatment. Then I realized that that is precisely where her "coolness" and her worth as a person comes from. Her confidence is what makes her a content, self-reliant and happy person, and the fact that she is able to make this conscious choice and act on it is what gives her reason to be so confident.
            </p>
            <h3>"Fake it Til You Make It" really works</h3>
            <p>
              So confidence is the most important value to me because I believe that it the doorway to living out all your other values, whatever they may be. "Fake it til you make it" has always been a motto of mine. It works. And not because you fool everyone in the world when you "fake" something-- but because you fool yourself. And you fool yourself right out listening to all your fears and insecurities, and you go for it, and when you go for it without hesitation, you will surely feel proud of yourself even if you fail. And the next thing you know, there is no negativity left for you to "fake" ignore.
