				<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
					<h2>What Is It?</h2>
					<h3>an explanation from Reducing Stereotype Threat.org:</h3>
					<p>
						"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group    (Steele & Aronson, 1995). This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes.""
					</p>
					<h2>My Experience</h2>
					<p>
					I have experienced stereotype threat in myself. When I was in high school, I was a really excellent math student. I loved math and excelled at it. I started the math team at my school, and the math club, and I even took math classes at other schools so I could do more interesting and advanced math. </p>
					<p>
						I went to the same all girls school from kindergarten through senior year.
					</p>
					<p>
						My feelings about math and my own abilities changed drastically (albeit temporarily) very shortly after I got to college. When I started taking math classes at Columbia, the rooms were filled with men who seemed to belittle me, whether they intended to or not. I had gone to the same all girls school from kindergarten through senior year. I was not used to being outnumbered by men in a math setting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Very quickly, a cycle of insecurity started forming for me. If I didn't understand something, I would notice how I was one of the only few girls, notice how the men in the study halls I was in were treating me (one very literally said to me, "oh, she thinks she has the answer. That's so cute" when I actually did have the answer.) I felt like I was so different from these people, how could I be good at math when you have to be like them to be good at math. The main thing about them was that they were mostly men. Then I would think that maybe I had only thought I was good at math when I was being compared to only girls, in my school. Then I would even start to feel resentful toward my old teachers and peers who made me feel like I had a special gift for math because I now felt they must have been misleading me for some reason.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had come to college very excited to major in math, and by second semester I wanted to drop it altogether.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ended up revisiting math again later when I was more receptive. In hindsight I honestly think that the first few years of college instilled a growth mindset in me where there had previously been a fixed one. I struggled for the first time in a while in college, which I think I needed. By my junior year, I think I had enough grit to struggle with math without believing that needing to struggle with it meant I was "bad" at it.
					</p>
					<p>
						For this reason I also see how there is a strong correlation between fixed mindset and stereotype threat. I can imagine that a growth mindset being instilled could help children weather the effects of stereotype threat--not to mention you really cannot have sustained success without a growth mindset, regardless of stereotype threat.
