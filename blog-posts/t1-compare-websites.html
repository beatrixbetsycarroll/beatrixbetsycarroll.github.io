				<h1>Comparing Some of my Favorite Sites: The Rap Insider, New York Magazine, Genius.com</h1>
				<h2>The Rap Insider</h2>
				<p>
				I love this site because of the hilarious content first and foremost...and I also think it is pretty good looking. I like its simple fonts and the uniformity of formal elements. I also like the red, white and black color scheme. I feel like color schemes that have a lot of secondary colors look cheesy because they clash with the photos (obviously I am aware that my site is quite cheesy). Having red just makes the photos pop and everything still seems to match.
				</p>
				<p>
				At first glance my eye is drawn to the large slideshow photo on the top left. After stepping back, I think my eye is also drawn to the "Join TRI!" announcement and the logo on top.
				</p>
				<p>As for the presentation on the site, I would say the site is minimalist, a little tacky, has a hip hop vibe, is organized, and easily readable.</p>
				<p>This site provides quick and light entertainment for those who are into rap and satirical news. It solves the problem of, "can there be a "The Onion" of hip hop?</p>
				<p>Regarding the contect of the site, I would say it is pop-culture-oriented, subversive, sarcastic, and silly, and critical.</p>
				<p>Browsing through ALL the content is not that easy. From how the site is laid out, its difficult to get an accurate sense of how many posts there are. Might be intentional since this is not real news so the stuff knd of expires faster and looking at old posts is not very common.</p>
				<p>After being on the site for a while, I get the feeling that I have spent my break in a fun way, "wasting time" but in a nice and pleasant way.</p>
				<p>The site sells t shirts, I have not purchased one but I would like to!</p>
				<h2>New York Magazine</h2>
				<p>When I am about to get on the train and know I am going to be bored, I try to quickly load some interesting pop cultural articles from here.</p>
				<p>First place my eye is drawn is the ad on top.</p>
				<p>I would describe the site as cluttered, busy, classic, somewhat good-looking, hipster, nerdy, cool.</p>
				<p>The web site solves the problem of filling the niche for high-brow type people looking to read some interesting stories on pop cultural stuff of with an upper-middle class white interest slant, more low-brow type things.</p>
				<p>The web site solves the problem of filling the niche for high-brow type people with pper-middle class white interests who arelooking to read some interesting stories on pop cultural stuff including more low-brow type things.</p>
				<p>I would describe the content as snarky, pretentious, silly, hip, liberal.</p>
				<p>I think this site is very difficult to navigate, Its hard to fine everything, and there is a lot going on.</p>
				<p>After being on the site for a while I often feel frustrated having looked for something to read for a while and getting stuck going in circles or just having diffuculty finding something that interestes me because of how disorganized it is.</p>
				<p>The site doesn't sell anything as far as I know (other than the stuff it advertises).</p>
				<h2>Genius.com</h2>
				<p>I use this site often because I love knowing rap lyrics and reading people's interpretations of their meanings.</p>
				<p>My eye is drawn to the Genius logo. Visually, this web site is dark, masculine, edgy, stylish, and a little busy.</p>
				<p>This web site solves a few problems: where can one get reliable lyrics for every type pf music? Where can people read about the meanings of these lyrics, including the meanings according the general public as well as according to the artist? And where can people post their interpretations? And now, more recently and over time, the site answers the question of, where can people annotate/find annotations on anything and everything? If Wikipedia is where you can find out what things are, Genius is where you can find out what they mean, line by line if its a text, second by second if its a film, etc etc.</p>
				<p>I would describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site as: ambitious, information-heavy, complex, philosophical, "meta", systematic, knowledge-spreading, important, and fascinating. I think that the site is visually somewhat incongruous with its aims, however it all started with rap and I see that in the presentation. Maybe they would benefit form making the site more bland and wikipedia-like if they want it to be considered a one stop shop for opinion collections that are aggregated, monitored and moderated by unbiased individual.</p>
				<p>It is somewhat difficult to find things on the site. There is a bug wherein if you scroll to the bottom to read the information on the footer, contents will continue loading on the page, so the footer will move down and you'll have to scroll again, etc etc ad infinitum! So in some cases its impossible to find information if what you are looking for is on the footer.</p>
				<p>It's also very difficult to understand what happened to your annotations taht you have made after you made them. I think that it would be a very difficult process to represent well visually, but I think their current method is pretty bad.</p>
				<p>I love looking on the site for long periods of time, reading about the lyrics of my favorite rappers and getting to know them better as artists. I especially love reading the artist's own annotations. The site doesn't sell anything.</p>
