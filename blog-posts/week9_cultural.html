        <h1>Asking the Right Questions</h1>

            <h2>Does this character flaw make my soul look fat? Asking "real" questions</h2>
            <h3>The world needs yesmen and straightshooters. Or at least I do.</h3>
            <p>
              When I have a question, I know I have people who will tell me what I want to hear, and others who will tell me what I might not want to hear. I may be inclined to ask my "yesman" friends for advice when I already know what I want to do and just want a little support from people. I think a lot of us are like this. But I mostly turn to . For instance, my mom and brother are incredibly blunt, and I know I can trust them to give it me straight regarding any recent haircut, possible weight gain, or joke idea for my stand up routine that I might be worried about.
            </p>
            <h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
            <p>
              I think the best questions are the ones that lend themselves to the best feedback. And the best feedback is specific, actionable, and kind. So I think your question should be: pointed and not vague, open-sounding (like you are ready to receive real criticism), and not hostile. This sounds simple but it is often easier said than done, especially if you are asking your question out of frustration after trying to solve something yourself for a very long time.
