						<h1>Javascript</h1>
						<h2>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h2>
						<p>
						A lot of it has to do with history and context. When there is a giant wildfire in the forest, no one asks, "Gee what was so special and flammable about that first branch that caught fire? Because surely if it weren't for that particular branch, there would have been no wildfire!" That would be sillly. Instead you ask, "What were the conditions in the forest that day that allowed any branch to catch fire and cause such a huge conflagration? And furthermore, given those conditions, what kind of branch could be eligible to start a fire?" Javascript's creator was smart...and lucky...and he was smart enough to know what would be "lucky". He saw an opportunity, he saw a void, and he saw what it would take to fill it.</p> 

						<p>Javascript was developed by Brendan Eich while he was working for Netscape. It was first released in 1995, so this was when Netscape was a popular browser. As one of the most popular browsers, Netscape was positioned to heavily influence the programming community with its choice of languange.</p> 

						<p>Soon Microsoft adopted it as the language for their web browser, Internet Explorer. So at this point those were the two major browser competitors fighting over the web--Netscape and Internet Explorer. So a lot of programmers turned to the language since it would be something that both of the most popular browsers could understand.</p>
						
						<p>The most popular browsers today all still support javascript, and allow you to debug in it. But these historical settings that allow for JS to be very popular are obviously just as much an effect of Javascript's ubiquity as they are cause. The Web's present day landscape is heavily influenced by Javascript's preexisting popularity.</p>
						<h2>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h2>
						<p>Javascript was designed to be a lightweight interpreted language so that it would appeal to non-professional programmers as well as proessional ones. By "interpreted language" we mean that you don't need to compile each program into machine-language instructions beforehand. Instead, the interpreter can just do all that in one step, both running the program and translating each part into a rudimentary language that cane be read by the machine. For this reason it was at first frowned upon by snooty legitimate developers, but it ultimately helped make the language so successful.</p>

						<p>It is object oriented which is also an advantage. In an object oriented language, you can make any thing you want to do in the code an object, and can therefore make it repeatable. You can make a function an opject and call it again later on a totally different element, whereas in structured programming, the content of any function has to happen in full in the code each time you use it.</p>

						<p>Javascript is super robust, allowing a developer to make pages that interact with the user, collect information, and manipulate the browser itself. Its object oriented and very good at carrying out huge tasks without taking a big toll on load time. The language has nothing to do with Java, it's name was simply a marketing ploy to capitalize on the already established reputation of Java.</p>
						
						<h2>What are its limitations?</h2>
						<p>Compared to newer language's like Ruby, it can seem very syntax-sensitive. You need a lot of symbols and they need to be jsut so, whereas Ruby can connect more dots for you in its interpreter.</p>
						<p>Javascript is wearer on backend stuff. It cannot access backend databases without a server side script. Similarly, you can't write to a file on the backend without running an AJAX request to run a server side script to write to the file on the server side.</p>
						<p>Javascript can't do multithreading. Multithreading is the ability of a computer program to handle more than one request or user at a time without needing to run another instance of the program. So you can easily understand how you would want your program to handle multithreading, since conceptually, anything who's burden correllates directly to how much you are using it is not good in computer science. You want things that burdened multiplicatively with each user/request, but just increase by a small increment instead.</p>
