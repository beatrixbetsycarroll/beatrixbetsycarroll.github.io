						<h1>My Learning Style</h1>
						<h2>About my Learning Style</h2>
						<p>
						According to the Gregorc thinking style quiz, I am a concrete random thinker. (Fun fact: I took the quiz twice 2 weeks apart and got nearly identical results. Only one point was different and it was not in my most dominant personality type category.) You can read about the different personality profiles <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target=blank>here.</a> I also found a lot of useful information <a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm" target=blank>here</a> that I really agreed with for myself personally. Here is what they had to say about my type:</p>
						<p>Concrete Random thinkers prefer</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Trial and error approach</li>
								<li>Hands-on experiences</li>
								<li>Brainstorming and open-ended activities</li>
								<li>Produce real, but creative, products</li>
								<li>Original and unique approaches to problem solving</li>
								<li>Self-directed learning</li>

							</ul>

						<p>Concrete Random thinkers struggle with:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Pacing and meeting time limitations</li>
								<li>Completing projects</li>
								<li>Choosing one answer</li>
								<li>Keeping detailed records</li>
								<li>Prioritizing</li>
								<li>Accepting others' ideas without showing another way</li>
								<li>Accepting when change is impossible</li>
							</ul>
						<p>The Concrete Random thinker is:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Is highly curious.</li>
								<li>Finds out-of-the-ordinary answers to problems.</li>
								<li>Seems driven to say or do things in a way others have not.</li>
								<li>Is a risk-taker.</li>
								<li>Likes to discover his/her own way of doing things; must test things for self.</li>
								<li>Is extremely independent and competitive with self.</li>
								<li>Prefers to investigate and experiment; enjoys hands-on experimenting.</li>
								<li>Skips steps and details.</li>
								<li>Shows original creativity; has varied and unusual ideas.</li>
								<li>Has multiple projects going at once.</li>
								<li>Finds possibilities, creates change.</li>
								<li>Is notorious for not reading directions or instructions.</li>
								<li>Fears structure.</li>
							</ul>
						<p>I find pretty much everything in those lists to be true about myself...but that can be one of the tricks of reading personality profiles. They can be very easy to relate to and see oneself in, just as horoscopes can feel accurate even to astrology skeptics because they can touch on a lot of universal elements of human experience.</p>
						<p>However I think this seems to have some validity, which is especially evinced by the flaws it lists for my type. I have seen in myself all of "struggle" qualities listed, and have kind of thought of them as quirks that don't match the rest of my personality, but clearly there is some consistency in the inconsistencies among a certain type of person.</p>
						<p>For instance I am very competitive with myself and always have a ton of projects going on, but I am extremely bad at prioritizing. People I know find it funny how bad I am at prioritizing when they see me doing it live, because at the end of the day I am a very productive person. When I am trying to clean my room, one second I am sorting laundry and the next thing I know I am rehanging all my paintings, only to realize that this makes no sense as a task when I still have clothes all over my floor...I often catch myself "gilding the lily" out of an inability to prioritize and execute more pressing tasks. I literally have to ask my roommate for "assignments" and "tasks" when we are trying to get the house ready for company.</p>
						<p>Another example of qualities in myself that I thought seemed contradictory and therefor not frequently coincidentital in a person is how I am highly curious and yet also THE WORST at reading instructions. It can often be really embarrassing in my job as a quality assurance engineer...I am great when it comes to playing around with things to understand a system and finding and reading outside materials to learn more, but I can't get myself to process all the information that is in "required reading" for something...like the story on pivotal. Just pretty interesting to see that these things can often go hand in hand.
						<h2>Struggles So Far</h2>
						<p>My biggest struggle has without a doubt been figuring out what is required of me. I am super bad at reading and following instructions, and it has definitely come out in this experience. I found the way DBC is organized to be very unclear at first, with various pieces of important information and important user interfaces where I am supposed to do things all spread across different sites. Now I think I am getting the hang of it better, but I do still often miss steps when I am trying to do an assignment.</p>
						<p>I think my strategy will be trying to make myself actually read things start to finish, before trying to look for shortcuts to find just the most crucial information. I also want to try to reach out to other students and teachers more when the class starts onsite. I want to make sure that I really understand everything I need to do, and have confirmed with others, before I start diving in and doing things wrong. Right now that seems unrealistic since I don't want to annoy people over digital forums when I should just be better at following directions, but I have less qualms about double checking with people in person when it would just be a quick question.</p>
						<p>Time management would probably have been a problem if I were doing more reasonable time boxxing. Instead I have really just been spending a tonnnn of time on DBC work outside of my job because I have been enjoying it and learning a lot. I have often let tasks take way too long just because I am loving it. This won't fly once DBC on site starts and the work picks up. Then I will need really figure out everything that needs to get done ahead of time, make a plan with set times, and timebox myself.</p>

						<h2>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</h2>
						<p>To expand my horizons learning wise, I will need to step out of my comfort zone. I think I learn with a lot of trial and error in coding, and I need to incorporate other approaches more since this is a very limiting method. I need to focus more on reading and understanding before I resort to testing it out myself.</p>
						<p>I think I should also work on how I learn from others. As my profile says, I can have trouble accepting others' ideas without wanting to show my own. I need to try to be more empathetic when I am communicating with people and remind myself that others' ways of doing things are just as valid and even more important to my learning than constantly expressing my own ideas.</p>
